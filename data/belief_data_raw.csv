The former is an Entisol, a tropical soil with high iron content and low organic matter. The second is an Alfisol, which is more weathered and has higher clay, silt, and organic matter content. Local farming systems include a mix of compound and bush fields cultivated by rural households. Compound fields surround homesteads, are cultivated permanently, receive various amounts of amendments from rubbish heaps or livestock pens, and are typically planted with cereals, vegetables, and fruit trees. Bush fields are located at some distance from homesteads (ranging from 0.5 km to a few kilometers), and may be differentiated into upland or lowland fields, suitable to a variety of crops, such as millet, maize, groundnut or maize. They receive less input than the compound fields. In both communities, the main crops are millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Farmers in Bacfassagal also produce sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), which are often intercropped with millet or peanut. In Paoskoto, wetter conditions allow farmers to produce maize, especially early-maturing varieties (the most popular one is an 80-day variety known as Early Thai). Rainfed rice (Oryza sativa) is also cultivated in valley bottoms and some farmers grow water melon and pumpkin in compound plots. In both communities, farmers usually plant millet prior to the rain, applying varying amounts of organic manure and, sometimes, chemical fertilizers. Peanut and maize are generally sown after a few big rains when farmers believe that the rainy season has really started.

In most early-season tropical rice fields, abundant populations of generalist predators can be found in (Settle et al. 1996). These generalist predators are likely to be supported, in the early season, by feeding on abundant populations of detritusfeeding and plankton-feeding insects, whose populations consistently peak and decline in the first third of the season. The abundance of alternative prey gives the predator populations a ""head start"" on later-developing pest populations, thus enabling them to strongly suppress pest populations and generally lend stability to rice ecosystems by decoupling predator populations from a strict dependence on herbivore populations.

Thus, this study compared the efficiency of rice production between large-scale irrigation schemes and small-scale irrigation schemes using household data collected in the Senegal Ricer Valley. The regression analyses demonstrate that large-scale irrigation schemes are as efficient as small-scale irrigation schemes when we control for the quality of irrigation facilities. That is, the seemingly better performance of large-scale irrigation schemes in the Senegal River Valley mainly comes from better management of irrigation facilities at the scheme level. However, the small-scale irrigation schemes are heterogeneous since they include village-based collective irrigation schemes and private irrigation schemes. If we compare large-scale schemes with village-based small-scale ones only, the former perform better even after controlling for observed advantage. The results imply that village-based small-scale collective irrigation schemes have inherent problems in irrigation management. Thus, we conclude that a part of the reason for the high productivity in rice farming in the Senegal River Valley can be attributed to the advantage of large-scale irrigation schemes over small-scale schemes.",NEGATIVE,large-scale irrigation schemes,less efficient,,,,,

Farmers also tend to prefer older seedlings, and consider them better adapted to agronomic stresses. For example, several participating farmers experienced problems with seedling mortality in SRI, which necessitated post-transplant gap filling. Poor land leveling is common in the study region, and farmers experienced failed crop establishment in field depressions where single, young SRI seedlings became submerged and/or washed away during the first irrigation, supporting Senthilkumar et al.

High ridged paddy cultivation by Diolas is mainly seen in the coastal sandy paddy fields, where high saline content water always threatens. In such fields, A.8 8 salinization of soils somewhat occurs in the dry season, but due to sandy in texture, certain amount of rainfall can leach out salts rapidly from surface soils, and strongly acid and highly salty groundwater in the root zone is gradually pushed down. In this method, therefore, transplanting is done at the top of the ridges in which salts are leached out by the rainfall at the early rainy season, and the roots are elongated following the desalinization of sub-soil layer. While avoiding the damage by salt at the initial growth stage, it enables early sowing and transplanting to some extent, resulting in the extension of the growth duration of paddy in the field, which brings about the stable and increased yield. Especially at present when rainfall has decreased, it is considered that this method, by advancing the maturity period, helps to lessen the damage induced by the raise of groundwater at late October. In those days when the submerged water was at the height of the waist, high ridges might have helped to avoid submergence of the seedlings.","POSITIVE, POSITIVE","this method, this method","advancing the maturity period, lessen the damage",,,,,

The small-scale processors purchase the paddy from farmers and from producer organizations through spot transactions including relational proximity. They visually check the quality of paddy for impurities. Their simple husking technique does not require complex indicators of quality in transactions. Producer organizations that benefit from a credit from CNCAS market their paddy to the small-scale processors and repay the loan to the bank with the money they get for the sale.

This empirical framework combines two potential characteristics of the interactions between farmers‘ decisions to apply and eventually obtain credit and the associated productivity outcome, namely, endogeneity of and self-selectivity (Maddala and Nelson 1975). In effect, it is assumed that some unobserved characteristics may well affect both the probability of being credit-constrained and productivity (say, a weather shock that tends to simultaneously reduce performance and reduce farmers’ credit-worthiness). In addition, the prospects of gaining from credit in terms of increased capacity and performance could well be a driver to farmers’ likelihood to enter the market and seek credit. Neglecting these issues, as a regular Ordinarily Least Squares (OLS) estimation would do, could lead to biased and inconsistent estimates. The model is used by many to address similar issues, such as Ali, Deininger, and Duponchel (2014) and Awotide et al.

Doublecropping of rice, which requires readjustment of the standard cropping calendar, is considered in Senegal to be an important component of the national food self-sufficiency program known as the Great Agricultural Offensive for Food and Abundance (GOANA). The ASI rice thresher-cleaner, an improved post-harvest technology developed and released in 1997, aims to reduce post-harvest labor bottlenecks and increase the quality of grain from irrigated rice farming in the Senegal River Valley (SRV). Modern evaluation or treatment effect theory is applied in this paper to evaluate the adoption and impact of this improved post-harvest technology. Firstly, the adoption rate is estimated and its determinants are identified. The Average Treatment Effects (ATE) methodology for technology adoption is applied to obtain consistent estimates of the true population adoption rate. Secondly, the impact of ASI adoption on labor demand and time during threshing is estimated through the matching approaches. The results show that the ASI thresher helps irrigated rice farmers to cope with labor scarcity by decreasing significantly the amount of labor and time needed. The labor-gain is about seven to 10 man-days and threshing time reduced by two to four days per hectare. This labor saving significantly increases the potential for double cropping. The true ASI adoption rate would have been 86% if the entire population of irrigated rice farmers had been exposed to it. The socioeconomic characteristics that increase the probability to adopt the ASI thresher are farmer experience, farm size, participation in ASI field experiments and/or contact with service providers, and the lag between ASI invention and first awareness. Indeed, irrigated rice farmers who recently became aware of the ASI thresher represent a strong group of potential adopters.",POSITIVE,Doublecropping of rice,important component,,,,,

However, in the case of the 1999 flooding evaluated based on a 30-years return period by Henny (2012), peak flow rates of the upper boundary at Podor should be constrained to less than 1800 [t/s], because the simulation result indicated that flooding may occur if this flow rates are exceeded. As shown in Figure 4, the storage capacity of Lake R’kiz is too small to prevent flooding. As an alternative, we suggest cooperative flooding control utilizing both Lake R’kiz and another reservoir. There are several small natural reservoirs along the Senegal River. Especially, near the confluence point, a large reservoir named Kundi exists and could be used to better control potential for flooding. In addition, the growth stages of rice should be considered for optimum flooding control. Kotera et al. (2016) demonstrated that rice yields are significantly damaged by submergence when submergence occurs during the flowering stage of rice. Moreover, before harvest season, paddy fields need to be dried in order to use a harvester. In Mauritania, the middle to end of October, and the beginning of November correspond to flowering and drainage stages, respectively. Thus, flood damage should be controlled during these periods to maintain stable rice yields. 4.3 Consideration of water use for irrigation in the dry season Conveyance to Lake R’kiz affects not only flooding control but also water use. According to its estimated storage capacity, approximately 326 million tons of water could be stored. This water resource has the potential to allow cultivation of approximately 27,200 ha based on the 5 mm per day of water requirement of a paddy field growing rice for eight months each year.",POSITIVE,growth stages of rice,should be considered,,,,,

The range of critical levels for K availability in rice soils ranges from 0.1 to 0.4 cmol kg soil−1 (e.g. Doberman et al., 1995), which is also the range of average values found in the sampled fields. Electrical conductivity and exchangeable sodium (Na) are very high in the middle delta. Extreme values of the latter are due to an overestimation by the CEC analysis, since the extraction method used also desolves accumulated neutral salts in the soil sample. Soils in the delta are saline due to marine salt deposits in the subsoil (Le Brusq, 1980) and potentially acid sulfate soils are common. This explains increasing pH-values going upstream. Soil pH values measured were between 4.7 and 7.2 with average values in the medium acid to slightly acid range.

The main pest species in the SRV are generally ploceid weavers, particularly the Red-billed Quelea and the Golden Sparrow (Bruggers and Ruelle, 1981 and Ibrahima Diop, chief of DPV Saint-Louis, personal communication). The Red-billed Quelea is one of the most notorious pest bird species in the world. It occurs in subSaharan Africa where it gathers in vast flocks of several million birds and breeds in gregarious colonies which can cover more than 100 hectares (with about 30,000 nests per hectare). It is considered the most numerous bird worldwide with population numbers totaling about 1.500 million at the end of the breeding season (Elliott, 1989). Its staple diet consists of wild annual grasses, yet when this natural source becomes scarce during the dry season, cultivated cereals become their alternative food source. Until present day, the Red-billed Quelea has received a serious amount of study and there are many publications describing its pest status and control strategies in African agriculture (see: Bibliography of the African quelea species, Oschadleus, 2001). The golden sparrow is mainly responsible for damage to ripening sorghum and to a lesser extent to irrigated rice and millet (Bruggers and Ruelle, 1981). Just like the Red-billed Quelea, its staple diet consists of seeds of wild grasses. It can be found in smaller groups of around 150 to 200 individuals and its roosting sites are far less dense with around 30 to 50 nests per hectare (Sidibé et al., 2003).",bad example,,,NOTE: this could be positive but the aspect here is it,,,,

The first recommendation is to carry out research to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in order to design an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. The implementation of an insurance system (started few years ago in Senegal) could prevent producer organizations unable to repay loans from being excluded by the national bank and from turning to less profitable marketing options. Nevertheless, the development of insurance systems for agricultural credit in Africa faces several challenges. There are issues involving adverse selection and moral hazards that require costly information systems to be overcome. Furthermore, there are many risks that require insurance coverage, and some of them such as civil security, are not usually covered. Finally, certain risks such as climatic shocks may affect large areas, which may compromise the principle of solidarity among producers in the same region. Research projects are needed to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in the Senegal River valley, and to develop an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. There is a particular need to develop an information system on the risks, their magnitude and their effects on farmers. Similarly, production contracts could be considered as providing the best insurance system for producers who represent the highest risk of loan default. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the implicit insurance cost is determined, and how the imbalance of power, due to the oligopsonistic structure of the credit market and the lack of funding opportunities for producers, influence the implicit rate of interest. The negotiation of the production contract price, with a specific breakdown of its components, should be an inherent focus of the inter-professional organization.",POSITIVE,production contracts,best insurance system,,,,,

In the first form, farmers were required to find their own purchaser, which often led to delays in sales and in farmers’ receiving payment. In the second form, banks provided credit to farmers who sold the contract on a forward sale to a processor, all of which was done at a price agreed in advance. Once transfer to the processor actually took place, the proceeds were used to repay the loan, with the loan now being between the bank and the processor. In this process, no cash was actually used; repayment was effectively in the form of paddy rice deposited in a warehouse.

The analyses of the salinity effects on yield components in relation to ®nal yield indicate an adaptation strategy to salinity in IKP and Sahel108 as HI remains unchanged up to salinity levels of 5 mS cmÿ1 (Sahel108) and beyond (IKP) in the HDS accompanied by a reduction in yield by 30±40%. This supports the results of Asch et al. (2000b) who showed that salinity affects all plant organs in a similar way if permanent salt stress is applied. Nonetheless, salinity at EC >2 mS cmÿ1 seemed to mark the critical level for all varieties tested here. In both seasons and in all treatments, yield reductions were tolerable up to that EC value, except for IR31758 in WS. In summary it can be postulated, that regardless of the phenological stage of the crop in Sahelian environments at ¯oodwater salinity levels >2 mS cmÿ1, irrigation and drainage cycles are needed to reduce the salt load and to avoid yield losses.

However, the development of insurance systems for agricultural credit in Africa faces the challenges of adverse selection and moral hazards. Research is needed to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in order to design an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. Second, the production contract could be considered as providing the best insurance system for producers who present a higher risk of loan default.

Second, all the simulation results should not be taken as precise forecasts, but rather as indications of trends and policy impacts obtained under a precise set of assumptions. Those projections are useful to learn about the general causal relations, the unintended and unexpected side-effects, the impeding and counteracting factors for improvement to support the development of coherent and effective strategies for development.

As dung contains seeds, cattle are seen as a major vector for dissemination of wild rice (which is considered as weed). Straw residues are burned, so cattle do not spend too much time in the field grazing on these residues.

This output oriented damage abatement specification (i.e. DA inputs reduce the loss inflicted on potential output) was questioned however by Carpentier and Weaver (1997), who proposed an input damage abatement specification which was further elaborated by Oude Lansink and Carpentier (2001). The input damage abatement specification is a more general treatment and is based on the principle that DA inputs have an impact on the productivity of productive inputs. Zhengfei et al. (2005) expanded the DA literature further by proposing an input damage abatement specification that allows marginal products of pesticides to be negative (these were presumed to be positive a priori in previous literature) and allows inputs to be both damage abating and yield increasing. One year later, Zhengfei et al. (2006) broadened this DA framework by presenting a new dichotomous paradigm based on agronomic insights that categorizes inputs into growthand facilitating inputs. Kuosmanen, Pemsl and Wesseler (2006) step aside from the standard production function approach to estimate the productivity of damage control inputs and employ a two-stage semi parametric technique to estimate the productivity of damage control inputs. This approach combines the attractive features of both nonparametric features (e.g. no need for assumptions about functional forms and parameter restrictions) and parametric features (e.g. the ability to summarize productivities into a single coefficient). In this specification, they specify damage agent variables as slope dummies, which they show to have a major impact on the effectiveness of the DA inputs they considered. Despite the recent development of the input DA approach in the literature, an output DA approach can still be meaningful however when an input DA approach is not preferable due to its high level of non-linearity and the related estimation problems.",POSITIVE,slope dummies,have a major impact on the effectiveness,NOTE: wasn't sure how to interpret this one,,,,

The policy sequencing proposed by Demont and Rizzotto (2012) faces difficulties in moving from the stage of quality improvement to increase in quantity. The policies implemented aim at replacing the traditional processing sector by the modern one, instead of modernizing the traditional sector. A way to avoid the shortfalls experienced by industrial rice millers is to include the banabanas in the modernization of the VC. The traditional VC has existed since the early phase of rice marketing in Senegal and still prevails despite several attempts at replacement. It should be considered as an opportunity for modernization since it has strengths that industrial units do not have. Small-scale units are able to get their supplies thanks to proximity with farmers, and they operate at low cost. Nevertheless, they face two constraints. The first one is technical, since their processing units only perform the husking function and output low quality rice. The quality of their production may be improved by helping them get access to compact unit rice millers (Cruz, 1999), which separate the hulling and blanching operations and may be coupled with a grader. Such semi-industrial techniques would increase processing yields, and bring the rice quality up to the level of industrial millers (Cruz, 1999). It would also enable small units to keep their flexibility and lower operating costs. Nevertheless, the compact unit requires importing rubber rolls, so national stocks need to be established. The second constraint faced by banabanas is financial. The cost of compact units is more than FCFA 2 million, which is twice the price of the units they currently use. Investment loans could be offered by CNCAS, with guarantees and insurance. Furthermore, banabanas have a limited cash flow. I therefore recommend the opening up of investment and operating credit to small-scale processors. The inclusion of these traditional processors in the modernization process would have pro-poor effects, particularly targeting youth and women (Clayton et al., 2013).","POSITIVE, POSITIVE","it, it","should be considered, strengths",,,,,

First, organizations should be considered in their diversity. In particular, MOs and COs do not require similar types of assistance. MOs typically generate income opportunities for their members, and management capacity is crucial for the organization to access resources and manage them effectively. By contrast, COs are essentially redistributive organizations. For this reason, financial support to COs through grants and loans is critical for them to have public goods and transfers that they can distribute to members. Second, VOs are highly dependent on the community context in which they evolve. In some cases, efforts should be made to encourage the emergence of MOs otherwise constrained, either through support to local entrepreneurs, or through the provision of efficient insurance mechanisms so that differentiation is no longer perceived as a threat to the community. The encouraging observation is that elite capture and corruption do not appear to be constraining factors on performance. What organizations need to effectively make a difference in enhancing revenues for their members and their communities is greater access to professional capacity building and to financial resources. Only then will extensive presence of organizations translate into more than penny capitalism, and effectively support successful smallholder agricultural development and improved rural well being in West Africa.",bad example,,,"NOTE: i think it's positive but i wasn't sure how to approach this one -- I think this is just evaluation criteria, not a sentiment",,,,

Rice production in the inland valleys is mainly for subsistence (Windmeijer and Andriesse, 1993).

ARC de Mey.txt,"They define a specific function g ( Z ) , the damage abatement function , to describe the DA inputs ’ specific role in production : , .",describe,"They define a specific function g(Z), the damage abatement function, to describe","The DA literature arose from publications about pesticide productivity and has mainly focused on the correct specification of the production function. In the traditional production function specification, , all inputs X are treated symmetrically, i.e. they are assumed to contribute to production in the same way. Lichtenberg and Zilberman (1986) criticized this specification by proposing an asymmetrical specification that treats productive inputs X and damage abating inputs Z differently. Their rationale behind this is that damage abating inputs are not standard factors of production that directly increase yield, but are damage control agents which indirectly mitigate yield loss through the elimination of pests. They define a specific function g(Z), the damage abatement function, to describe the DA inputs’ specific role in production: , . The DA function represents the percentage of damage that is eliminated by the use of the DA inputs Z and possesses the properties of a cumulative probability distribution: it is defined on the interval [0,1] with g = 0 meaning zero elimination of damage, g =1 denoting complete eradication of damage, it is a monotonically increasing function and g(Z)  1 when Z  ∞. A simple linear form of the asymmetric specification is     , where represents minimal output and potential output on which works as a scaling factor. Choosing minimal output equal to zero, this equation is reduced to   . This equation symbolizes that the DA production function approach is based on the damage abatement process that is multiplicatively separable from the production process: the DA function g(Z), representing the percentage of prevented damage, influences potential yield f(X) as a scaling factor. Following its definition, one minus the DA function represents the pest-inflicted loss function at various pest control levels. Thus by estimating a production function with an embedded DA function, farm level bird damage estimates can be obtained by feeding the loss function with observed pest control levels. Note that the DA function uses bird control efforts as an input to represent the abatement process; hence this approach uses bird control as a proxy to estimate bird damage.",bad example,,,,,,,

The women were able to accurately describe the characteristics of the grain and flour, the related agricultural practices (e.g. crop cycle, seasonality), the interests and disadvantages of cultivating the variety, and the management of seeds. This was explained by the fact that seed management and breeding were traditionally the responsibility of women. All these varieties were local or peasant. A summarized description of the 8 most cited recession sorghum varieties and photographs can be found in Tables S1 and Fig. S3 in Result S1 in Online Supplementary Material. Briefly, the 3 most frequently cited varieties were Poordi (which means brown, the color of the seed), Mariam Sowdou (from the name of the woman who introduced and spread it) and Balieri (which means white). Yellow variety (Paaca) was also mentioned. The choice of cultivating one or another variety was guided by the length of the crop cycle (e.g. the Poordi cycle was 20 days shorter than the Balieri cycle) and bird attacks (e.g. the Balieri was less sensitive compared to Poordi). As a result, the Poordi variety was the most cultivated while its bitter taste (a protective factor against bird attacks) was less and less appreciated by the families. Among the 19 other varieties mentioned, the cultivation of most of them has been abandoned due to longer cycles (e.g. Bobo jamm and Samba Souké). In addition, the decrease in flooding for several consecutive years has had consequences for the seed conservation of these different varieties. Because the maximum storage time is two years according to women involved in sorghum breeding, and because of the uncertainty of the next floods, women progressively stopped keeping seeds and preferred to buy them at the market or from neighbors. Nevertheless, some women did their best to save sorghum seeds.",UNDETERMINED,the characteristics of the grain and flour,,,,,,

Thus, the work of women in the transmission of culinary knowledge is of great importance, and this makes the kitchen the primary place for maintaining biodiversity.

Rice cropping systems in Africa may often be suitable for integrated approaches to pest management.

Though farmers’ impressions could change with additional experience, higher fuel costs, or increased physical water scarcity, only farmers from the small-scale and privately managed Oumar Youness irrigation scheme considered AWD to be feasible. For the time being, irrigation cost reductions may be more easily achieved by reducing conveyance losses, and by maintaining pumps for high fuel efficiency.

The lean period is a constant preoccupation for women. The participatory survey revealed that in the Waalo rice enters into land competition with the traditional floodbased organization and that this poses a real problem for families because of the attachment to traditional systems for technical, economic, food and cultural reasons, as other authors have found (Le Roy, 2007; Bruckmann, 2018). As typically in small family farming, the diversification of sources of income and food production is the main strategy of the families. The recession cultivation of sorghum fulfilled this function perfectly because it cost much less to grow (requiring less work and no inputs) and provided more money than rice that is sold by the kilo for twice the price. Nevertheless, such a strategy faced several limitations. Aiming for food security much more than for the achievement of good rice yields placed the families at odds with the demand of the public authorities transmitted by SAED which relates only to the objectives in terms of irrigated area and annual production: the rice production is expected to increase from 455,000 tons in 2018 to 875,000 tons in 2020. As a consequence of this mismatch between local and national objectives, families cannot but deplore the lack of technical and financial support from public authorities for the carrying out of diversification activities. Another important limitation was the land constraint, especially because the Waalo lands prone to flood recession culture are never sold if not occupied by rice, tomato or onion (Bruckmann, 2018). According to the perception of being food secure, defined by families as being able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice and having extra assets from off-farm activities or expatriates, different strategies of production and limitations were described (Table 1).",bad example,discovery: 'expected' is a trigger word and not a very good one,,,,,,

This activity proved more challenging than expected, not always translating into consistent results. In some cases farmers’ claims that forecast use led to increased peanut yields were contradicted by their marks on the worksheet. In other cases, farmers did not change practices, but estimated their yields differently between the two rounds. Farmers’ yields assessments were, therefore, replaced by the appraisal of an agronomist from CERAAS/CIRAD (Centre International en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement) who has been working in the area for several years. For each field, each farmer and in each year, the agronomist compared the cropping activities by pairs (with and without forecast). He focused on changes of: crop cultivar, sowing date, harvest date, and use of fertilizers/manure and timing. He then compared these changes with the observed rainfall data to decide if they would have a positive, negative or null effect on yield. His assessment is therefore only relative. We detail in Table A4 the main changes reported by the experts for each category of impact (positive, null, negative) and in Table A5 three concrete examples of how he proceeded. This produced a database of 177 cases, with a case being defined as the comparison of round #1 and round #2 for a particular farmer, field, and year.

Even the application of N fertilizer alone (FMO2, FMO3, FMO8, and FMO9) produced similar yields compared to the recommended NPK (FMO1). Otherwise, N fertilizer should be ~ 35 ~ applied each season but P and K nutrients could be applied in one season per year without any yield reduction. One application per year of 26 kg P ha-1 supplied by the recommended dose of NPK fertilizer seemed to provide enough P for two seasons. Investigating the importance of soil extractable P on rice yield, Bado et al. (2007) determined a critical limit of 9 mg P kg-1 (Bray 1 P). P becomes a limiting factor for increasing rice yield when the soil supplies less than 9 mg P kg-1 and P fertilizer should be applied under such conditions in order to increase rice yields. Above this value, responses to P fertilizer applications are not expected (Bado et al., 2007). Data of soil extractable P should be used to confirm the necessity to apply P fertilizers to overcome this limiting factor. However, the values of 7.5 and 8.2 mg P kg-1 at the two sites were very close to the critical limit (9 mg P-Bray1 kg-1). The recommended dose of NPK that supplies 26 kg P ha-1 seems to provide enough P to maintain soil extractable P around or beyond the critical limit. This can explain why one application of 26 kg P ha-1 per season can maintain good levels of soil extractable P and rice yields for two cropping seasons as we observed at the two sites. Based on our data, this is true when soil extractable P is very close to the critical limit of 9 mg P kg-1.",UNDETERMINED,responses to P fertilizer applications,,,,,,

Little information is available to farmers and the choice of herbicides to manage the risks of resistance is not available. Herbicide use is expected to increase in the near future and, with it, resistance is likely to develop. Environmental changes can accelerate this and, for example, raised CO2 levels have been shown to increase the tolerance of weeds to herbicides (Ziska et al., 1999; Ziska and Teasdale, 2000). Reasons behind this effect are not clear, however, rising CO2 levels may alter transpiration, reduce the number of leaf stomata or alter the thickness of the weed leaf, and thereby reduce the absorption or uptake of the pesticide (Ziska, 2008).

Early experimental studies have shown evidence of its superior technical performance (Kanté 1997) and financial profitability (Donovan and Douthwaite 1997) and recently, Diagne et al. (2013) have found that the ASI thresher-cleaner significantly increases technical efficiency of irrigated rice production. Our study focuses on an observational approach of impact assessment with the application of the causal or treatment effect framework from the perspective of modern evaluation theory (Diagne and Demont 2007; Imbens and Wooldridge 2009). First, the consistent adoption rate of the ASI thresher and its determinants are estimated to assist mainly in the development of strategic and steering programs for future investment in small-farm equipment in the SRV. Second, the impact of the ASI thresher on threshing labor and time is assessed through Matching approaches/parameters. Adoption of a technology is motivated by its impact on profits and labor saving is the primary motivation for mechanical threshing (Pingali 2007), The coexistence of rice and vegetable growing in the SRV leads to frequent shortage of labor during rice harvest and post-harvest periods when the labor requirement peaks for these operations and then cycles into a further labor peak for transplanting of vegetable crops at the end of the wet season. The adoption of the ASI thresher is a priori expected to decrease the amount of labor needed and to save time for threshing activity. A consequence of adopting the ASI thresher is lower pressure from the calendar constraints of irrigated rice cultivation which can ease sufficiently to accommodate double-cropping as recommended in the Senegalese Great Agricultural Offensive for Food and Abundance (GOANA) program. The GOANA aims at reaching rice self-sufficiency in Senegal by 2015 (FTF 2010; SAED 2008).

To the contrary, by providing support to local entrepreneurship, MOs are expected to induce economic and social differentiation of their members from the rest of the community. Because this may jeopardize the traditional structures of authority as well as the mutual insurance system within the community, the community will often resist the emergence of MOs (Fafchamps, 1992; Platteau, 2000). Therefore more social pressures to share (proxied by more social homogeneity) and more rainfall variability (representing the need for more sharing) can be expected to constrain the emergence of MOs. Social conservatism can limit the emergence of MOs, at a net social cost for the community (Hoff & Sen, 2006; Kuran, 1988).",UNDETERMINED,economic and social differentiation,,,,,,

As the yield level is rather low at present, it is relatively easy to increase yield and profit by improving rice growing environment through strict farm management. In the various demonstration plots, the paddy yield increased by 150 – 250%, from 0.6 2.0 ton/ha to 2.0 3.8 ton/ha, by applying 50 to 70 kgP2O5/ha as TSP or DAP under the ridges and 40 to 50kgN/ha as urea once or in two split times.

For extending such fertilizer application technique, it is first to be done that the local technician show farmers the effectiveness of the technique and expected benefit through the field demonstration. In each village, at least a measuring tape and a balance should be equipped so that they could calculate and weigh the necessary amount of fertilizer through the measurement of the field plot area.

Despite the presence of chlorophyll and photosynthetically active leaves (Press et al., 1991), these parasitic plants can severely reduce growth and development of the infected host plant. They parasitize host roots through a xylem-to-xylem connection made by a special organ, the haustorium (Parker and Riches, 1993). Through this connection, the parasite subtracts host-plant metabolites, water, nutrients, and amino acids (e.g., Press et al., 1987; Rogers and Nelson, 1962) and alters the hormone balance (Drennan and El Hiweris, 1979; Frost et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1996).

Red brown upland soils develop under the forests in the highest land, and palm trees are grown from the edge of the forests down to the edge of upper slopes where red brown to light yellow brown soils develop. On the upper slopes where gray soils develop, upland rice is grown and/or nursery is prepared1. Soils of the successive upper slope are relatively of hydro-morphic, and utilized for the rainfed paddy cultivation which depends on groundwater. However, the growth of paddy is unstable due to the decreased groundwater level resulting from the decrease in rainfall. On the middle slopes is the best rice cultivation area where water is usually sufficiently available and no fear of salinity hazard or acid toxicity. Near the water course, saline contents increase rapidly, which often results in standing dead after transplanting, but as soil fertility is high, the highest yield is expected when sufficient rainfall is obtained2. Beyond this where marshy land extends, soils are called “tanne”, showing very low pH with high salinity. In particular, bared “tanne” has the highest salt content, which sometimes becomes salt pan in the dry season3. On the mangrove area, where pH increases, young alluvium with high organic matter content is deposited. In some area, paddy fields near the water course are adjacent to “marigot”, small stream of the end of tributaries or back water. 4. Overview of rice cultivation (1) Farming practice In the Lower Casamance area, transplanting is a common practice. Nursery is prepared by burning trees near the rainfed paddy field, or utilizing a part of paddy field in case of flat lowland, at the beginning of rainy season, in early to mid-July. Sowing and transplanting is done when rainfall stabilizes, which tends to delay nursery work and prolong nursery period, resulting in weak and poor seedlings when transplanted. Land preparation and weeding is done from early August to early September when the paddy field starts to be submerged.","NEGATIVE, POSITIVE","saline contents increase rapidly, sufficient rainfall","standing dead, highest yield",,,,,

However, in recent years, the consumption of rice has rapidly increased. Particularly, in West African countries, annual rice consumption per capita has tripled over the past 40 years (Africa Rice Center, 2005). This increase, observed in the urban areas, is perhaps because rice requires a shorter time to cook than other cereals (Hiraoka, 2017). In West African countries, where economic development is expected to accelerate in the future, urbanization is expected to be promoted partly by increasing rice consumption (Tsuboi et al., 2008). However, the domestic production of rice remains low, as evidenced by the 2.5 [t/ha] of land-based rice productivity in West Africa in 2005 (Africa Rice Center, 2007). According to Figure 1, recently, consumption has significantly exceeded production. To meet the increasing demand for rice, 6 million tons of rice are imported every year (Stryker, 2013). In 2008, when the food crisis occurred, a significant number of West African countries experienced starvation due to steep increases in the price of imported rice.

Though farmers’ impressions could change with additional experience, higher fuel costs, or increased physical water scarcity, only farmers from the small-scale and privately managed Oumar Youness irrigation scheme considered AWD to be feasible. For the time being, irrigation cost reductions may be more easily achieved by reducing conveyance losses, and by maintaining pumps for high fuel efficiency.

Rural women are constrained because of sociocultural factors that deny them control over land resources, but also because the land legislation that does support them is not enforced. Rural women are victims of an inequitable and highly patriarchal social structure that prevents them from accessing and controlling their means of production (Niang et al. 2017:9). For example, the inheritance of land still functions according to customary land rights and is dependent on women’s marital status, meaning that women risk losing their land if they get divorced or widowed (Koopman, 2009). Looking at gender disparity statistics, Senegal’s ranking in the gender inequality index has not witnessed any improvements in women’s rights. The score of 2018 was set to 0.682, in comparison to 0.6923 in 2013 (World Economic Forum, 2013;2018). The ranking index states that the higher the score, the more gender-equal the society is.

As typically in small family farming, the diversification of sources of income and food production is the main strategy of the families. The recession cultivation of sorghum fulfilled this function perfectly because it cost much less to grow (requiring less work and no inputs) and provided more money than rice that is sold by the kilo for twice the price. Nevertheless, such a strategy faced several limitations. Aiming for food security much more than for the achievement of good rice yields placed the families at odds with the demand of the public authorities transmitted by SAED which relates only to the objectives in terms of irrigated area and annual production: the rice production is expected to increase from 455,000 tons in 2018 to 875,000 tons in 2020. As a consequence of this mismatch between local and national objectives, families cannot but deplore the lack of technical and financial support from public authorities for the carrying out of diversification activities. Another important limitation was the land constraint, especially because the Waalo lands prone to flood recession culture are never sold if not occupied by rice, tomato or onion (Bruckmann, 2018). According to the perception of being food secure, defined by families as being able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice and having extra assets from off-farm activities or expatriates, different strategies of production and limitations were described (Table 1).",NEGATIVE,competition with the traditional floodbased organization,problem,,,,,

This specification enables estimating bird damage, averaging around 11.2% of the potential rice yield during the wet seasons of 20032007. This translates into an average annual economic loss of 4 billion FCFA (€6.2 million) for the irrigated rice sector in the Senegal River Valley.

Lack of product uniformity is perceived by consumers in West Africa to lead to longer cooking times and unpredictable preparation requirements, as the cleaning and sorting of this rice prior to cooking is thought to take longer and be more laborious. Credit arrangements also impact the choice of local versus imported rice: Traders in urban areas are reluctant to carry local rice because of lack of credit from wholesalers, whereas credit is generally available from importers and the wholesalers to whom they sell. Senegalese consumers, however, more than consumers in other West African countries show preferences for local, valued Senegal River Valley rice over imported rice due to its taste characteristics, even if impure and poorly sorted. Well-branded rice, designating place of origin, local fragrant rice, also received price premiums. (Diagne et al. 2017; Demont et al. 2012, Rutseart et al 2018) The investment of the government of Rwanda in good quality, but medium sized mills of 1-3 t/hr is proposed as a viable solution in West Africa, where rice may be milled more locally but also of better quality, to compete with imported rice.

First, organizations should be considered in their diversity. In particular, MOs and COs do not require similar types of assistance. MOs typically generate income opportunities for their members, and management capacity is crucial for the organization to access resources and manage them effectively. By contrast, COs are essentially redistributive organizations. For this reason, financial support to COs through grants and loans is critical for them to have public goods and transfers that they can distribute to members. Second, VOs are highly dependent on the community context in which they evolve. In some cases, efforts should be made to encourage the emergence of MOs otherwise constrained, either through support to local entrepreneurs, or through the provision of efficient insurance mechanisms so that differentiation is no longer perceived as a threat to the community. The encouraging observation is that elite capture and corruption do not appear to be constraining factors on performance. What organizations need to effectively make a difference in enhancing revenues for their members and their communities is greater access to professional capacity building and to financial resources. Only then will extensive presence of organizations translate into more than penny capitalism, and effectively support successful smallholder agricultural development and improved rural well being in West Africa.","POSITIVE, POSITIVE, NEGATIVE","emergence of MOs, emergence of MOs, differentiation","efforts should be made, encourage the emergence, threat to the community",,,,,

The ASI thresher is perceived by farmers as a moderately to highly time and labor saving technology with low to moderate grain recovery performance (Table 1). However, farmers were more concerned with the moderate grain quality achieved and the relatively modest number of machines available in the region. During the survey period, some 23–50% of farmers were not satisfied with the quality of private service operators and expressed the need for improving the performance of ASI threshing services.

Secondly, this study is embedded in a larger framework of experimental value chain research, in which it is believed that competitiveness of the food sector in developing countries can be increased through collective value chain and generic promotion strategies exploiting, to a maximum extent, social capital and networks.

Compound fields surround homesteads, are cultivated permanently, receive various amounts of amendments from rubbish heaps or livestock pens, and are typically planted with cereals, vegetables, and fruit trees. Bush fields are located at some distance from homesteads (ranging from 0.5 km to a few kilometers), and may be differentiated into upland or lowland fields, suitable to a variety of crops, such as millet, maize, groundnut or maize. They receive less input than the compound fields. In both communities, the main crops are millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea).

In some cases farmers’ claims that forecast use led to increased peanut yields were contradicted by their marks on the worksheet. In other cases, farmers did not change practices, but estimated their yields differently between the two rounds.

For each field, each farmer and in each year, the agronomist compared the cropping activities by pairs (with and without forecast). He focused on changes of: crop cultivar, sowing date, harvest date, and use of fertilizers/manure and timing. He then compared these changes with the observed rainfall data to decide if they would have a positive, negative or null effect on yield. His assessment is therefore only relative.

Both rice millers and farmers can initiate the contract. They share relational proximity because the managers originate from the village and hire local workers. The contract is a written one, and includes the amount of inputs the miller provides to farmers: seed, fertilizers, herbicides and/or mechanized services. The miller may also implement the technical support and have the power of decision over irrigation and harvest. The quality of paddy required is the same as in a marketing contract. The miller does not have to pay producers because 100% of producer organizations participating in production contracts supply no more than the quantity of paddy equal to the value of the credit. Rice millers prefer contracting with farmers who cultivate large areas but also resort to producer organizations. They do not finance investments by the producers, who consequently must have prepared irrigated land. The millers reported a collection radius of 50 kilometres. When there is a conflict, producers and the miller renegotiate.

The species Q. quelea primarily feeds on seeds of cereal crops, grasses in field margins and weedy crop fields but also on insects (Elliott, 1979). They prefer seeds of grasses in general and that of Echinochloa spp. in particular. Most noxious weeds in irrigated rice in the Sahel are the grasses Oryza barthii A.

In the SRV most farmers rely on chemical weed control, using a combination of propanil and 2,4-D, followed by hand weeding (e.g. Haefele et al., 2002a). Against birds, seasonal chemical control is often routinely executed by the Senegalese Crop Protection Directorate near important bird roosts. This involves the use of large quantities of non-selective avicides, often organophosphate insecticides like cyanophos and fenthion, that are toxic to many bird species, including non-seed eaters, as well as reptile and fish species, posing serious environmental hazards (Mulli e et al., 1999; McWilliam and Cheke, 2004; Cheke et al., 2012, 2013).

Poor land leveling is common in the study region, and farmers experienced failed crop establishment in field depressions where single, young SRI seedlings became submerged and/or washed away during the first irrigation, supporting Senthilkumar et al. (2008) and Tsujimoto et al. (2009), who observed similar problems in India and Madagascar, respectively. Several SRI studies have also examined the effect of seedling number and transplanting age on yield (e.g., Latif et al., 2009; Tsujimoto et al., 2009), though the advantages of either practice remain inconclusive. We therefore suggest that it is best to adopt a flexible approach to transplanting practices, only using single, young seedlings in low-risk environments where farmers are certain of their ability to minimize constraining agronomic and social factors.","POSITIVE, POSITIVE","older seedlings, older seedlings","prefer, better adapted",,,,,

Millers claimed to select producers mainly based on observable characteristics. The distance between the farm and the miller determines participation in contracts because the millers’ collection radius is around 50 km. Moreover, the volume of supplies available from farmers matters for contracting companies (Barrett et al., 2012). Rice millers in Dagana département claimed to select producers and producer organizations on the basis of the irrigated area they farm. In this paper, we use the number of members of the producer organization as a proxy for the surface area farmed by the producer organization because part of the data about the surface area was missing. Contracting companies also select farms based on non-land assets (Reardon et al., 2009). Some millers stated that they prefer to purchase paddy from the wealthiest households with the highest number of active members and the most experience. A previous study of French beans in Senegal also identified the fact that ethnicity influenced participation in contracts (Maertens and Swinnen, 2009). One of the millers’ selection criteria less frequently cited in the literature is farmers’ access to warehouses, as it enables better control of the moisture rate. Nevertheless, millers reported that recent increases in the regional milling capacity and competition with traditional processors caused them to be less exacting with regard to these characteristics.",POSITIVE,paddy from the wealthiest households,prefer,,,,,

The other varieties are still available locally, preserved by some families and sold in the bush markets; they are still present, too, in culinary memories. The women were able to accurately describe the characteristics of the grain and flour, the related agricultural practices (e.g. crop cycle, seasonality), the interests and disadvantages of cultivating the variety, and the management of seeds. This was explained by the fact that seed management and breeding were traditionally the responsibility of women. All these varieties were local or peasant. A summarized description of the 8 most cited recession sorghum varieties and photographs can be found in Tables S1 and Fig. S3 in Result S1 in Online Supplementary Material. Briefly, the 3 most frequently cited varieties were Poordi (which means brown, the color of the seed), Mariam Sowdou (from the name of the woman who introduced and spread it) and Balieri (which means white). Yellow variety (Paaca) was also mentioned. The choice of cultivating one or another variety was guided by the length of the crop cycle (e.g. the Poordi cycle was 20 days shorter than the Balieri cycle) and bird attacks (e.g. the Balieri was less sensitive compared to Poordi). As a result, the Poordi variety was the most cultivated while its bitter taste (a protective factor against bird attacks) was less and less appreciated by the families. Among the 19 other varieties mentioned, the cultivation of most of them has been abandoned due to longer cycles (e.g. Bobo jamm and Samba Souké). In addition, the decrease in flooding for several consecutive years has had consequences for the seed conservation of these different varieties. Because the maximum storage time is two years according to women involved in sorghum breeding, and because of the uncertainty of the next floods, women progressively stopped keeping seeds and preferred to buy them at the market or from neighbors.

Globally, in irrigated plots of the Waalo, under the responsibility of the men, almost exclusively owners of the land, the women were carrying out different strategic tasks (transplanting, weeding, guarding the cultivation against birds, harvesting) for the production of rice, onions and tomatoes. The new agro-system organization has created a novel female status, that of the ‘woman who helps’, which means she loses all family and social recognition. Even when migration kept young men absent and women were involved in many tasks, they very rarely gained recognition with strategic bodies (Top, 2014). When the lack of manpower made it necessary to make choices between crops in the irrigated Waalo or flood basins, the family choice gave priority to irrigated plots and rice that became strategic for the families’ food security and for earning money. The Waalo has thus lost its place as a feeding ground to irrigated areas, and to rice, which is now the staple food of the peasants.

Probably far more than any other crop, rice can grow under diverse geographical, climatic and cultural conditions. The quality preferences of rice consumers, over millennia, have resulted in a wide diversity of varieties specific to different localities. Rice has a unique center of origin in West Africa, for the African rice species (Oryza glabberrima). According to Cubry et al (2018), the Oryza glabberrima was domesticated in the inner Niger Delta.

Under experimental conditions, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to pay an 18 percent price premium for imported Thai 100 percent broken rice relative to conventional, ungraded SRV rice. However, they were willing to pay an even larger price premium, 35 percent, to obtain enhanced-quality SRV broken rice. Conventional, ungraded SRV rice is a mix of varieties, has a mediocre grain quality, and is commonly available on the market. Imported Thai 100 percent broken rice has a grain quality somewhere between the conventional and the enhanced-quality SRV broken rice and contains some impurities. Enhanced quality SRV broken rice is purified and homogenized through one or two sifting operations. On top of the price premium of 35 percent for enhanced quality SRV broken rice, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to add another 6 percent for a branded rice product, paying an overall price premium of 41 percent for PINORD’s Rival® (see Box 1) relative to conventional SRV rice. These findings suggest that Senegalese consumers are willing to pay for intrinsic food quality attributes and that SRV rice is able to compete against imported rice if post-harvest quality is tailored to consumer preferences. 11 But also breeding currently plays a role in tailoring quality to urban consumer preferences. In 2011, three fragrant rice varieties bred by AfricaRice (Sahel 177, 328 and 329) have been introduced in the SRV. Given that an important market segment of urban consumers (particularly in Dakar) prefers imported fragrant rice, this introduction opens the door for the development of domestic value chains of fragrant rice and further replacing imports with domestic rice. 11 Enhancing quality in the context of a food insecure country may seem counterintuitive at first, but is consistent with similar findings in Asia revealing that even the very poor have more income elastic demand for food quality than for food quantity (Shah, 1983).",POSITIVE,imported fragrant rice,prefers,,,,,

During the preceding generation, all household members worked on the family plot, resulting in one shared income, which was managed by the husband. This type of management is called the ‘co-operative model’ since resources are pooled, and harvests are shared instead of splitting up into several units amongst the family members. Today, the household’s husband and wife manage and cultivate their own plots individually. This type of management is called the ‘non-cooperative model’ since resources are not shared amongst family members, and the husband and the wife work separately on their respective fields which is their own responsibility (Quisumbing et al. 2014; Croppenstedth et al. 2013; Udry et al. 1995; Udry, 1996; Goldstein and Udry, 2008; Diiro et al. 2018).

Since the project began, Senegal has more than doubled rice output, producing some 40 percent of domestic annual consumption. That impact is particularly evident in the Saint-Louis region of the Senegal River Valley, the fertile swath of land that straddles the country’s northern and eastern border with Mauritania. One of Naatal Mbay’s larger partners in the region is Maka Diama, a farmer network representing some 416 smallholders with approximately 400 hectares under cultivation. “Before working with Naatal Mbay, the farmers were producing about 4 tons of rice per hectare,” says Assane Diop, the network’s president. “Now, with higher quality fertilizer and certified seeds, it’s almost twice that amount.” Diop adds that the increased production owes in part to new GPS-enabled devices and training on their use. The devices, part of a suite of easy-to-use digital tools made available by Naatal Mbay, have helped farmers make precise measurements of their fields and, thus, more accurate estimates of the amount of seed and fertilizer needed for planting. Diop says one might assume that technological devices such as laptops have no place on a farm. “But the Garmin [GPS] is simple, and the information is important — not only for us but for the banks.” Sacks of rice for sale at a small roadside factory operated by Khar Yalla Gueye, a women’s association in Pont Gendarme, in the Saint-Louis region of Senegal.

With their crop as their only collateral, smallholder farmers struggled to attract financing from banks wary of taking on the risk. A vicious cycle ensued; credit-strained farmers produced lower yields, leaving them with insufficient income to purchase the premium-quality seeds and fertilizer needed to turn a profit. As a result, many farmers and millers defaulted on their loans, further eroding banks’ faith in rice as a safe investment.",UNDETERMINED,rice value chain,,"It could be a negative opinion of the rice value chain, since they want to strengthen it, but you could want to improve something that isn't necessarily bad, so I wasn't sure.

SRI rice fields are thought to adapt better to climate change and give off fewer greenhouse gas emissions. SRI does not rely on new varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, or infrastructure to raise yields. Rather, it is a knowledge-based crop management approach that allows plants to better express their genetic potential, which leads to improved plant growth and productivity.

This activity proved more challenging than expected, not always translating into consistent results. In some cases farmers’ claims that forecast use led to increased peanut yields were contradicted by their marks on the worksheet. In other cases, farmers did not change practices, but estimated their yields differently between the two rounds. Farmers’ yields assessments were, therefore, replaced by the appraisal of an agronomist from CERAAS/CIRAD (Centre International en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement) who has been working in the area for several years. For each field, each farmer and in each year, the agronomist compared the cropping activities by pairs (with and without forecast). He focused on changes of: crop cultivar, sowing date, harvest date, and use of fertilizers/manure and timing. He then compared these changes with the observed rainfall data to decide if they would have a positive, negative or null effect on yield. His assessment is therefore only relative. We detail in Table A4 the main changes reported by the experts for each category of impact (positive, null, negative) and in Table A5 three concrete examples of how he proceeded. This produced a database of 177 cases, with a case being defined as the comparison of round #1 and round #2 for a particular farmer, field, and year. While this approach has obvious limitations, it nonetheless provided an estimate of potential impact of forecast use relative to a wide range of cropping practices and rainfall conditions.",bad example,,,agree,,,,

Proponents of SRI generally argue the agronomic and economic justification for each component as follows: (1) Careful, early transplanting reduces transplanting shock and optimizes tiller development; (2) Wider spacing encourages enhanced root development, interception of solar radiation and tiller production while reducing transplanting time. (3) Transplanting one hill per pocket reduces seed requirements considerably. Intra-specific (rice-rice) competition is also reduced thereby allowing each rice plant to express fully its production potential. (4) Nutrients in organic amendments are quickly made available to the rice crop when soils are intermittently flooded and dried. Organic materials help to build the soil’s inherent fertility level over time thereby facilitating high levels of crop productivity even when mineral fertilizers are lacking. This strategy is thought of as beneficial to resource-poor farmers. Organic materials also improve the functioning of the soil agroecosystem by increasing soil carbon content, water retention potential and by fostering a diversity of soil micro and macro fauna, many of which may be important to optimizing crop nutrient supplies.",POSITIVE,This strategy,beneficial,"It does not specify the strategy in this in this sentence, so I was not sure what we would want to do in this case.

For example, the reports of “super-high” rice yields have been widely condemned as faulty by researchers at a number of international institutions. Other critics highlight the risks and disadvantages that should be considered alongside the potential benefits of SRI’s principles, such as greater weed growth and high labour requirements, which is not always available to farmers in Senegal (Krupnik & Sarr 2008). In addition, SRI requires strict control over water/water regime for irrigation and drainage, and strict timing is necessary. Besides that this is not always available or feasible it also requires levelled land (Stoop, 2003). As Krupnik and Sarr (2008) state: “Where farmers cannot enact all of these principles, they are encouraged to adapt and alter parts of the system to fit site-specific agronomic, economic and cultural needs. SRI should consequently not be thought of as a pre-packaged technology; rather it represents an integrated rice production approach that encourages farmers to experiment with and optimize their management of soil, nutrient, water and biological relationships while attempting to maximize the efficient use of scarce natural resources”. This is essential to keep in mind as there might be circumstances in Senegal in which SRI is difficult to apply, for instance direct seeding is rather important in the SRV, there is a lack of equipment for mechanical transplanting, and rice straw and other rice by products are in various cases used for animal feeding.","POSITIVE, POSITIVE","integrated rice production approach, integrated rice production approach","encourages, optimize",updated a little,,,,

Under experimental conditions, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to pay an 18 percent price premium for imported Thai 100 percent broken rice relative to conventional, ungraded SRV rice. However, they were willing to pay an even larger price premium, 35 percent, to obtain enhanced-quality SRV broken rice. Conventional, ungraded SRV rice is a mix of varieties, has a mediocre grain quality, and is commonly available on the market. Imported Thai 100 percent broken rice has a grain quality somewhere between the conventional and the enhanced-quality SRV broken rice and contains some impurities. Enhanced quality SRV broken rice is purified and homogenized through one or two sifting operations. On top of the price premium of 35 percent for enhanced quality SRV broken rice, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to add another 6 percent for a branded rice product, paying an overall price premium of 41 percent for PINORD’s Rival® (see Box 1) relative to conventional SRV rice. These findings suggest that Senegalese consumers are willing to pay for intrinsic food quality attributes and that SRV rice is able to compete against imported rice if post-harvest quality is tailored to consumer preferences. 11 But also breeding currently plays a role in tailoring quality to urban consumer preferences. In 2011, three fragrant rice varieties bred by AfricaRice (Sahel 177, 328 and 329) have been introduced in the SRV. Given that an important market segment of urban consumers (particularly in Dakar) prefers imported fragrant rice, this introduction opens the door for the development of domestic value chains of fragrant rice and further replacing imports with domestic rice. 11 Enhancing quality in the context of a food insecure country may seem counterintuitive at first, but is consistent with similar findings in Asia revealing that even the very poor have more income elastic demand for food quality than for food quantity (Shah, 1983).",POSITIVE,local high-quality rice,willingness among urban consumers to pay a price premium,"Can the opinion words be part of the aspect?

First, we conduct an experimental auction on food in a poor, least developed country (LDC) under challenging conditions of high illiteracy, limited technical possibilities and low education levels. With the exception of Masters and Sanogo (2002), no similar market experiments have been published in the context of LDCs. While their study is based on a choice experiment, we use the auction mechanism as methodology to elicit WTP values. Surprisingly, very few experimental auctions have been published on developing countries, where consumers are usually more acquainted with negotiable prices and the market system, and are, therefore, more used to conforming their WTP to the food sellers’ willingness-to-accept (WTA) than consumers in developed countries. Moreover, these consumers typically spend larger shares of their budgets on food and demand for food is more elastic. In other words, they respond more actively to market prices necessitating frequent cognitive efforts to estimate their WTP and a better knowledge of market prices as the latter directly affect their welfare.",UNDETERMINED,developing countries,,agree,,,,

The number of schools benefiting from canteens dropped from 180 to 90 in two academic years, and by the end of November 2016 no school was running its canteen. The continuity of operating school canteens is a battle that is far from being won. Moreover, schools benefiting from PAA Senegal have not learned how to source directly from local producers to the extent that dealings between the two categories of beneficiaries has not been tested by the project. However, buying local products to feed the students is PAA Africa’s pioneering idea. WFP was directly responsible for purchasing rice from producers; the schools received rice directly from WFP and were not in direct relation with the producers. How can the concept then become functional if the project ends before the concept is tested?” Consumption patterns issues from a civil society perspective: Rice is a strategic cereal for Senegal, given its prominent place in the eating habits of Senegalese people and its weight on the country's trade balance. With an estimated demand of 3000 tonnes of rice per day, or an estimated consumption of 78 kg/year per capita, Senegal is one of the largest rice consumers in West Africa.

We also added three alternative predicting weighting schemes commonly used in the literature. Equal weighing yields a correlation coefficient of 0.60; any variable producing a weighing scheme with a correlation higher than this value is superior to ordinary averaging for predicting CWTP values and can be considered as a determinant of collective decision-making on the value of alternative rice types. The median is found to be an inferior predictor (0.55), while the “best rule”, i.e. the bid closest to the CWTP gets all the weight, obviously yields a superior correlation (0.73). Most of the individual socio-demographic variables are unobservable or quasi-observable (indigenous, higher education, trader, family income) to other participants in the group sessions. Age is the only strongly observable variable and our results show that it better predicts group response than ordinary averaging. This result is robust under both rescaling scenarios (0.64-0.67), implying that women tend to rely on this factor to attribute influence weights to their peers in group decision-making. This provides useful preliminary information for designing effective collective value chain and generic promotion strategies relying on social capital and networks.",UNDETERMINED,predicting weighting schemes,,agree,,,,

The ASI rice thresher-cleaner, an improved post-harvest technology developed and released in 1997, aims to reduce post-harvest labor bottlenecks and increase the quality of grain from irrigated rice farming in the Senegal River Valley (SRV). Modern evaluation or treatment effect theory is applied in this paper to evaluate the adoption and impact of this improved post-harvest technology. Firstly, the adoption rate is estimated and its determinants are identified. The Average Treatment Effects (ATE) methodology for technology adoption is applied to obtain consistent estimates of the true population adoption rate.

The results show that the ASI thresher helps irrigated rice farmers to cope with labor scarcity by decreasing significantly the amount of labor and time needed.

After careful consultation with participating farmers, extension agents and women involved in transplanting and weeding activities, we valued tasks performed by women or children at 50% the opportunity cost for an 8-h day of adult male labor. Small-scale equipment amortization costs were negligible compared to total expenses; we therefore assumed them to be sunk. Following local practices, harvesting labor was valued at a fixed rate. Threshing in the region is not paid monetarily; instead, farmers are charged in rice at a rate of 10% threshed grain.

(2013) similarly attributed efficiency gaps in irrigated rice production in the SRV to sub-optimal weed and fertilizer management, but further identified biotic (granivorous birds), technological, organizational and institutional constraints as major factors preventing SRV farmers from achieving optimal productivity and efficiency levels. An earlier econometric study on the same panel dataset of SRV rice farmers estimated mean rice yield losses due to bird attack at 13%, which was very consistent with farmers' perceptions, who assessed the damage to be on average 15% (de Mey et al., 2012). Finally, a continent wide survey among irrigated rice farmers provided a perceived yield loss estimate from bird and rodent attacks at 19% (Diagne et al., 2013b).",,,,,,,,

The recession cultivation of sorghum fulfilled this function perfectly because it cost much less to grow (requiring less work and no inputs) and provided more money than rice that is sold by the kilo for twice the price. Nevertheless, such a strategy faced several limitations. Aiming for food security much more than for the achievement of good rice yields placed the families at odds with the demand of the public authorities transmitted by SAED which relates only to the objectives in terms of irrigated area and annual production: the rice production is expected to increase from 455,000 tons in 2018 to 875,000 tons in 2020. As a consequence of this mismatch between local and national objectives, families cannot but deplore the lack of technical and financial support from public authorities for the carrying out of diversification activities. Another important limitation was the land constraint, especially because the Waalo lands prone to flood recession culture are never sold if not occupied by rice, tomato or onion (Bruckmann, 2018). According to the perception of being food secure, defined by families as being able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice and having extra assets from off-farm activities or expatriates, different strategies of production and limitations were described (Table 1).",,,,,,,,

This activity proved more challenging than expected, not always translating into consistent results. In some cases farmers’ claims that forecast use led to increased peanut yields were contradicted by their marks on the worksheet. In other cases, farmers did not change practices, but estimated their yields differently between the two rounds. Farmers’ yields assessments were, therefore, replaced by the appraisal of an agronomist from CERAAS/CIRAD (Centre International en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement) who has been working in the area for several years. For each field, each farmer and in each year, the agronomist compared the cropping activities by pairs (with and without forecast). He focused on changes of: crop cultivar, sowing date, harvest date, and use of fertilizers/manure and timing. He then compared these changes with the observed rainfall data to decide if they would have a positive, negative or null effect on yield. His assessment is therefore only relative. We detail in Table A4 the main changes reported by the experts for each category of impact (positive, null, negative) and in Table A5 three concrete examples of how he proceeded. This produced a database of 177 cases, with a case being defined as the comparison of round #1 and round #2 for a particular farmer, field, and year.

This initial phase was repeated for years 1977, 1979, 1992 in Paoskoto and years 1960, 1966, and 1985 in Bacfassagal, and was used as a baseline, to represent what farmers do normally, based on rainfall received but without access to forecast information.

The range of critical levels for K availability in rice soils ranges from 0.1 to 0.4 cmol kg soil−1 (e.g. Doberman et al., 1995), which is also the range of average values found in the sampled fields. Electrical conductivity and exchangeable sodium (Na) are very high in the middle delta. Extreme values of the latter are due to an overestimation by the CEC analysis, since the extraction method used also desolves accumulated neutral salts in the soil sample. Soils in the delta are saline due to marine salt deposits in the subsoil (Le Brusq, 1980) and potentially acid sulfate soils are common. This explains increasing pH-values going upstream. Soil pH values measured were between 4.7 and 7.2 with average values in the medium acid to slightly acid range. Plant available P, as estimated with Bray 1, also increases upstream and average values range from 3.5 to 4.2 mg P kg soil−1, which overlaps with critical levels reported in the literature (Sanchez, 1976). 3.2. Agronomic characterization for the 1997 wet season Forty-two farmers took part in the survey, but five farmers did not follow the experimental protocol and were excluded from the analysis. Land preparation consisted in 33 cases (90%) of one pass with a disk plow. Ploughing (three cases) was rare and in one case no land preparation was done. Pre-irrigation was used by 12 farmers (32%) and field leveling was rarely practiced (nine cases or 24%). The main cultivar used was Jaya, followed by TN1, IR28, IR1561, Sahel202 and Sahel108. In 60% of the cases, non-certified seed was used, taken from the previous harvest. Most fields were directseeded, with the exception of four fields, which were transplanted for seed production. Average sowing date was 18, July. Latest sowing date was 28, August, which caused spikelet sterility due to cold stress around flowering. Sowing density was on average 139 kg seed ha−1, which can be considered to be sufficient even if seed quality is not optimal. Minimum dosage used was 100 kg seed ha−1.",,,,,,,,

These changes are likely to cause a shift away from labor-intensive practices and to favor the implementation of direct-seeding (Rao et al., 2007), increased herbicide applications, reduced soil tillage operations, and increased cropping intensities. As a result, there are likely to be shifts in the composition in weed flora, a greater risk of herbicide resistance, and an increase in the incidence of challenging weed problems.",,,,,,,,

This is not the case for the participants in this study as women were more prone than men to engage in commercial activities. Due to the households ‘non-co-operative model’ in which husbands and wives do not share their incomes, women’s increased revenues were not controlled by their husbands.

Matilda_Strand-_BIDS_THESIS.txt,This is not the case for the participants in this study as women were more prone than men to engage in commercial activities .,,,"In a sense, this disputes the analytical results from Smith and Chavas (1997) who found that the commercialization of agricultural productions in West African households was typically done by increasing the production on male managed communal lands, meaning that husbands controlled the increased income. This is not the case for the participants in this study as women were more prone than men to engage in commercial activities. Due to the households ‘non-co-operative model’ in which husbands and wives do not share their incomes, women’s increased revenues were not controlled by their husbands. Thus, the commercialization of agricultural productions had, in fact, a positive effect on women’s empowerment.

1-s2.0-S0378429001001289-main.txt,IKP and Sahel108 are widely grown in the Senegal River Delta .,,,"In the present study, salinity was applied for only 14 days at varying levels during different, potentially salt sensitive developmental stages of the crop (Fageria, 1985) in order to simulate situations likely to arise under ®eld conditions. IKP and Sahel108 are widely grown in the Senegal River Delta. IKP is known for its yield stability and relative tolerance to salinity, whereas Sahel108 is well adapted to the Sahelian climate and has a high yield potential. IR31785, being considered for release to farmers in Senegal (WARDA, 2000), has a high yield potential but is extremely susceptible to salt. These characteristics are well re¯ected in our results. The analyses of the salinity effects on yield components in relation to ®nal yield indicate an adaptation strategy to salinity in IKP and Sahel108 as HI remains unchanged up to salinity levels of 5 mS cmÿ1 (Sahel108) and beyond (IKP) in the HDS accompanied by a reduction in yield by 30±40%. This supports the results of Asch et al. (2000b) who showed that salinity affects all plant organs in a similar way if permanent salt stress is applied. Nonetheless, salinity at EC >2 mS cmÿ1 seemed to mark the critical level for all varieties tested here. In both seasons and in all treatments, yield reductions were tolerable up to that EC value, except for IR31758 in WS. In summary it can be postulated, that regardless of the phenological stage of the crop in Sahelian environments at ¯oodwater salinity levels >2 mS cmÿ1, irrigation and drainage cycles are needed to reduce the salt load and to avoid yield losses. This is particularly important during the early reproductive stages of the crop.",,,,,,,,

IKP is known for its yield stability and relative tolerance to salinity, whereas Sahel108 is well adapted to the Sahelian climate and has a high yield potential.

The analyses of the salinity effects on yield components in relation to ®nal yield indicate an adaptation strategy to salinity in IKP and Sahel108 as HI remains unchanged up to salinity levels of 5 mS cmÿ1 (Sahel108) and beyond (IKP) in the HDS accompanied by a reduction in yield by 30±40%. This supports the results of Asch et al. (2000b) who showed that salinity affects all plant organs in a similar way if permanent salt stress is applied. Nonetheless, salinity at EC >2 mS cmÿ1 seemed to mark the critical level for all varieties tested here. In both seasons and in all treatments, yield reductions were tolerable up to that EC value, except for IR31758 in WS. In summary it can be postulated, that regardless of the phenological stage of the crop in Sahelian environments at ¯oodwater salinity levels >2 mS cmÿ1, irrigation and drainage cycles are needed to reduce the salt load and to avoid yield losses.

Rural women are constrained because of sociocultural factors that deny them control over land resources, but also because the land legislation that does support them is not enforced. Rural women are victims of an inequitable and highly patriarchal social structure that prevents them from accessing and controlling their means of production (Niang et al. 2017:9). For example, the inheritance of land still functions according to customary land rights and is dependent on women’s marital status, meaning that women risk losing their land if they get divorced or widowed (Koopman, 2009). Looking at gender disparity statistics, Senegal’s ranking in the gender inequality index has not witnessed any improvements in women’s rights. The score of 2018 was set to 0.682, in comparison to 0.6923 in 2013 (World Economic Forum, 2013;2018). The ranking index states that the higher the score, the more gender-equal the society is. This means that Senegal’s level of gender equality has decreased by 1.49 percent from 2013 to 2018. 2.2 Senegal’s economy and labor force composition To better understand the role of rice in Senegal, we will now look at Senegal’s economy at large, and its labor force composition, which indicates a growing service sector. While figure 4 indicates that the majority of the labor force have transferred from the agricultural sector to the service sector, this corresponds to figure 5 indicating that the economic value of service sector has increased significantly in comparison to the agricultural sector. However, it should be highlighted that the informal sector in Senegal is significantly larger than the formal, meaning that important information may be hidden from official records (World Bank (2019).",,,,,,,,

The score of 2018 was set to 0.682, in comparison to 0.6923 in 2013 (World Economic Forum, 2013;2018). The ranking index states that the higher the score, the more gender-equal the society is. This means that Senegal’s level of gender equality has decreased by 1.49 percent from 2013 to 2018. 2.2 Senegal’s economy and labor force composition To better understand the role of rice in Senegal, we will now look at Senegal’s economy at large, and its labor force composition, which indicates a growing service sector. While figure 4 indicates that the majority of the labor force have transferred from the agricultural sector to the service sector, this corresponds to figure 5 indicating that the economic value of service sector has increased significantly in comparison to the agricultural sector. However, it should be highlighted that the informal sector in Senegal is significantly larger than the formal, meaning that important information may be hidden from official records (World Bank (2019).",,,,,,,,

2013_Colen_RiceSenegalValuechains.txt,"Under experimental conditions , the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to pay an 18 percent price premium for imported Thai 100 percent broken rice relative to conventional , ungraded SRV rice .",,,"Recent evidence from experimental auctions in the urban markets of Dakar and Saint Louis confirms that there is a willingness among urban consumers to pay a price premium for local high-quality rice (Demont et al., 2013; forthcoming). Under experimental conditions, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to pay an 18 percent price premium for imported Thai 100 percent broken rice relative to conventional, ungraded SRV rice. However, they were willing to pay an even larger price premium, 35 percent, to obtain enhanced-quality SRV broken rice. Conventional, ungraded SRV rice is a mix of varieties, has a mediocre grain quality, and is commonly available on the market. Imported Thai 100 percent broken rice has a grain quality somewhere between the conventional and the enhanced-quality SRV broken rice and contains some impurities. Enhanced quality SRV broken rice is purified and homogenized through one or two sifting operations. On top of the price premium of 35 percent for enhanced quality SRV broken rice, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to add another 6 percent for a branded rice product, paying an overall price premium of 41 percent for PINORD’s Rival® (see Box 1) relative to conventional SRV rice. These findings suggest that Senegalese consumers are willing to pay for intrinsic food quality attributes and that SRV rice is able to compete against imported rice if post-harvest quality is tailored to consumer preferences. 11 But also breeding currently plays a role in tailoring quality to urban consumer preferences. In 2011, three fragrant rice varieties bred by AfricaRice (Sahel 177, 328 and 329) have been introduced in the SRV. Given that an important market segment of urban consumers (particularly in Dakar) prefers imported fragrant rice, this introduction opens the door for the development of domestic value chains of fragrant rice and further replacing imports with domestic rice. 11 Enhancing quality in the context of a food insecure country may seem counterintuitive at first, but is consistent with similar findings in Asia revealing that even the very poor have more income elastic demand for food quality than for food quantity (Shah, 1983).",,,,,,,,

Despite the presence of chlorophyll and photosynthetically active leaves (Press et al., 1991), these parasitic plants can severely reduce growth and development of the infected host plant. They parasitize host roots through a xylem-to-xylem connection made by a special organ, the haustorium (Parker and Riches, 1993). Through this connection, the parasite subtracts host-plant metabolites, water, nutrients, and amino acids (e.g., Press et al., 1987; Rogers and Nelson, 1962) and alters the hormone balance (Drennan and El Hiweris, 1979; Frost et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1996).

Upon further inspection of the annual differences, Table 4 indicates that farmers underestimated bird damage during the agricultural seasons 2003–2004 and overestimated bird damage during the agricultural seasons 2005–2007. In relation to the summary statistics of the bird pressure dummy in Table 2, the wet seasons during 2003–2004 were perceived as having no or low bird pressure and the seasons 2005–2007 as having medium or high bird pressure. These figures suggest that farmers have a dichotomous view regarding bird damage: if (i) perceived bird pressure is low, farmers do not perceive this damage as important and tend to underestimate bird damage; but if (ii) perceived bird pressure and the related damage is high, farmers tend to overestimate the true damage caused by birds. These findings indicate that the farmers’ bird damage perceptions are related to their attitudes towards risk: farmers are inclined to underestimate bird damage when risk of damage is low and to overestimate bird damage when risk of damage is high. This behavior has been studied in the psychological literature, where the comparison is frequently made between the perceived risk of traveling by air (low probability of an airplane crash but also low controllability) and traveling by car (slightly higher probability of a car crash but higher perceived controllability).",,,,,,,,

Because MOs provide support to production and marketing activities, one could expect that richer households benefit more from these organizations. Although our indicator is binary and does not capture possible differences in the level of benefits, the absence of clear differences does suggest that MO activities are in general equally favorable to all their members. However, as is clear from Table 1, a number of MOs also undertake public goods activities. One may, therefore, argue that poorer households, less able to benefit from production or marketing activities, essentially benefit from MOs through these public goods transfers.

First, policy responses to the prevailing issues in rice have been articulated by diverse stakeholders, but each has contributed from their personal knowledge, not through an elaborate multistakeholder process that should precede the confirmation and adoption of policies. Second, all the simulation results should not be taken as precise forecasts, but rather as indications of trends and policy impacts obtained under a precise set of assumptions. Those projections are useful to learn about the general causal relations, the unintended and unexpected side-effects, the impeding and counteracting factors for improvement to support the development of coherent and effective strategies for development. Third, the model is formulated at a high level of aggregation and focuses on the representation of the interlinkages between the different sectors. On the one hand that means that also in the agricultural sector, we analyse policies and effects from an aggregated perspective. On the other hand, this aggregation and macro perspective allows us to assess the intersectoral effects, dependencies and impacts. In a subsequent stage of the policy process these results should inform the use of sectorial models and other more detailed planning tools. Fourth, there are factors and causalities that are not integrated in the model. These are the results of a balancing act, in which we aim at integrating the main relevant links without including too many factors that would impede adopting a macro-perspective.

First, policy responses to the prevailing issues in rice have been articulated by diverse stakeholders, but each has contributed from their personal knowledge, not through an elaborate multistakeholder process that should precede the confirmation and adoption of policies. Second, all the simulation results should not be taken as precise forecasts, but rather as indications of trends and policy impacts obtained under a precise set of assumptions. Those projections are useful to learn about the general causal relations, the unintended and unexpected side-effects, the impeding and counteracting factors for improvement to support the development of coherent and effective strategies for development. Third, the model is formulated at a high level of aggregation and focuses on the representation of the interlinkages between the different sectors. On the one hand that means that also in the agricultural sector, we analyse policies and effects from an aggregated perspective. On the other hand, this aggregation and macro perspective allows us to assess the intersectoral effects, dependencies and impacts. In a subsequent stage of the policy process these results should inform the use of sectorial models and other more detailed planning tools. Fourth, there are factors and causalities that are not integrated in the model. These are the results of a balancing act, in which we aim at integrating the main relevant links without including too many factors that would impede adopting a macro-perspective. In addition, some interdependencies might not have been included in the model due to lack of data or other kind of evidence concerning that specific causal relationship. Finally, our model is implemented at the national level and does not account for diversity at the sub-national level, which should be considered for successful implementation.",,,,,,,,

Matilda_Strand-_BIDS_THESIS.txt,"’ This assumes that farming households would share the factors of production in an equal distribution ( the co-operative model ) , making it more likely to maximize agricultural efficiency .",,,"The results from both female group-, male individualand key informant interviews revealed that household’s agricultural plots had become individually instead managed of collectively. During the preceding generation, all household members worked on the family plot, resulting in one shared income, which was managed by the husband. This type of management is called the ‘co-operative model’ since resources are pooled, and harvests are shared instead of splitting up into several units amongst the family members. Today, the household’s husband and wife manage and cultivate their own plots individually. This type of management is called the ‘non-cooperative model’ since resources are not shared amongst family members, and the husband and the wife work separately on their respective fields which is their own responsibility (Quisumbing et al. 2014; Croppenstedth et al. 2013; Udry et al. 1995; Udry, 1996; Goldstein and Udry, 2008; Diiro et al. 2018). Recalling Section 3.2. in the literature review, the preceding generation’s agricultural management fit into the tenant of ‘Pareto efficiency.’ This assumes that farming households would share the factors of production in an equal distribution (the co-operative model), making it more likely to maximize agricultural efficiency. In the current individualized management system, this is not the case.

It should be considered as an opportunity for modernization since it has strengths that industrial units do not have. Small-scale units are able to get their supplies thanks to proximity with farmers, and they operate at low cost. Nevertheless, they face two constraints. The first one is technical, since their processing units only perform the husking function and output low quality rice. The quality of their production may be improved by helping them get access to compact unit rice millers (Cruz, 1999), which separate the hulling and blanching operations and may be coupled with a grader. Such semi-industrial techniques would increase processing yields, and bring the rice quality up to the level of industrial millers (Cruz, 1999). It would also enable small units to keep their flexibility and lower operating costs. Nevertheless, the compact unit requires importing rubber rolls, so national stocks need to be established. The second constraint faced by banabanas is financial. The cost of compact units is more than FCFA 2 million, which is twice the price of the units they currently use. Investment loans could be offered by CNCAS, with guarantees and insurance. Furthermore, banabanas have a limited cash flow.

valueChain0_2017_SOULLIER.txt,The traditional VC has existed since the early phase of rice marketing in Senegal and still prevails despite several attempts at replacement .,,,"The second recommendation is to include small-scale processors in the modernization process through the promotion of semi-industrial techniques and the opening up of operating and equipment loans. The policy sequencing proposed by Demont and Rizzotto (2012) faces difficulties in moving from the stage of quality improvement to increase in quantity. The policies implemented aim at replacing the traditional processing sector by the modern one, instead of modernizing the traditional sector. A way to avoid the shortfalls experienced by industrial rice millers is to include the banabanas in the modernization of the VC. The traditional VC has existed since the early phase of rice marketing in Senegal and still prevails despite several attempts at replacement. It should be considered as an opportunity for modernization since it has strengths that industrial units do not have. Small-scale units are able to get their supplies thanks to proximity with farmers, and they operate at low cost. Nevertheless, they face two constraints. The first one is technical, since their processing units only perform the husking function and output low quality rice. The quality of their production may be improved by helping them get access to compact unit rice millers (Cruz, 1999), which separate the hulling and blanching operations and may be coupled with a grader. Such semi-industrial techniques would increase processing yields, and bring the rice quality up to the level of industrial millers (Cruz, 1999). It would also enable small units to keep their flexibility and lower operating costs. Nevertheless, the compact unit requires importing rubber rolls, so national stocks need to be established. The second constraint faced by banabanas is financial. The cost of compact units is more than FCFA 2 million, which is twice the price of the units they currently use. Investment loans could be offered by CNCAS, with guarantees and insurance. Furthermore, banabanas have a limited cash flow. I therefore recommend the opening up of investment and operating credit to small-scale processors. The inclusion of these traditional processors in the modernization process would have pro-poor effects, particularly targeting youth and women (Clayton et al., 2013).",,,,,,,,

This increase, observed in the urban areas, is perhaps because rice requires a shorter time to cook than other cereals (Hiraoka, 2017). In West African countries, where economic development is expected to accelerate in the future, urbanization is expected to be promoted partly by increasing rice consumption (Tsuboi et al., 2008). However, the domestic production of rice remains low, as evidenced by the 2.5 [t/ha] of land-based rice productivity in West Africa in 2005 (Africa Rice Center, 2007). According to Figure 1, recently, consumption has significantly exceeded production. To meet the increasing demand for rice, 6 million tons of rice are imported every year (Stryker, 2013). In 2008, when the food crisis occurred, a significant number of West African countries experienced starvation due to steep increases in the price of imported rice. In terms of food security, the governments of these countries have adopted certain agricultural policies and projects to strengthen the rice production sector (Dupraz et al., 2013).",,,,,,,,

We initiated this approach by starting with certain emblematic, such as preparations based on cowpeas or sorghum coucous (niri) whose consumption has fallen sharply due to lower production and higher purchase costs. Different preparations are associated with niri: niri Kosam (with milk), niri bouna (with dried fish) or niri beref. There are emblematic dishes, still prepared for certain occasions such as baptisms and weddings and associated with good health and culinary heritage. This study confirms, notably following Howard (2003), that culinary traditions are a major element in the preservation of wild and cultivated biodiversity. If culinary traditions are diminishing, the reasons for conserving these plants useful for food, as well as the knowledge associated with them (cultivation, processing, and storage) are also being lost. Thus, the work of women in the transmission of culinary knowledge is of great importance, and this makes the kitchen the primary place for maintaining biodiversity. In addition to being a place for conserving plants, the kitchen is also a place for creating emotions and memories. Thus, to evoke food and its evolution is also to evoke the memories associated with it by appealing to the senses.",,,,,,,,
